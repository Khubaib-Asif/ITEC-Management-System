Project A: ITEC Event Management System
The Information Technology Exhibition and Competition (ITEC) is an annual event organized 
by the Department of Computer Science, UET Lahore. The event includes various activities 
such as competitions, exhibitions, seminars, and non-tech events. It is managed by faculty 
members and students, with responsibilities distributed across multiple organizing committees.
Currently, the event is managed manually using spreadsheets, emails, and physical records, 
leading to:
• Data inconsistency in participant registrations and payments.
• Difficulty in managing committee assignments and duties.
• Inefficiencies in financial tracking (sponsorships, registration fees, and expenses).
• Manual scheduling, leading to conflicts in event timings and venue allocation.
• Lack of automated reporting for participation, financial transactions, and event results.
To streamline event management, a centralized Event Management System is required to 
digitize and automate the entire process.
The system must address the following challenges:
• Event Management: Maintain structured event categories, schedules, and venues.
• Participant Registration & Fee Management: Track event registration fees and 
payments.
• Committee Management: Assign faculty and student members to specific organizing 
committees.
• Duty Assignments: Ensure each committee member (faculty or student) has a clear role 
and task.
• Financial Tracking: Manage event funding, sponsorships, registration fees, and expenses.
• Venue Allocation: Prevent scheduling conflicts by managing venue assignments.
• Automated Reports: Provide detailed reports on participants, finances, and event 
performance.
A desktop-based Windows Form Application using C# and MySQL will be developed to 
streamline event planning, participant management, committee roles, financial tracking, and 
duty assignments.
